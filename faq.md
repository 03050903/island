- Failed to clone app with error message:  
`"Island cannot clone apps without a proper built-in app market on your device (preferable Google Play Store)"`

This is a special requirement only on Android 5.0 devices. In most cases, your device will ship with an app store (e.g. Google Play Store) out of box.
If you received this error message, please consider upgrading your device to Android 5.1+, or switching to another ROM variant with app store built-in.
